# predicting-Sport-activity_type

I - Motivation
Being constantly at home for work and studyâ€¦ One can forget to exercise and be active. We want to design a system that will track past activities and based on the time, season and calories goals will predict the next activity.

Idea
We will build an application that stores on a daily basis the user location using GPS. After treating the data a machine learning algorithm will predict the future activity that will be visualized in a nightstand lamp printed in 3D.

Advantages
The user will know what sport activity he needs the next day and keeps track of his health to stay in shape.
